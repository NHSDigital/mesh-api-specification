  title: Hello World API
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API alongside our [tutorials](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/tutorials).
    You can learn to connect via:
      * open-access
      * application-restricted.
      * user-restricted.


    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest-apis). And is available via the Internet, and over the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    ## Authorisation
    This API showcases three differently authorised endpoints, [Open-access](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#open-access-apis), [Application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis) and [User-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis).
      * Open-access requires no authorisation.
      * Application-restricted requires an API key presented in the 'apikey' header along with the request.
      * User-restricted requires OAuth 2.0 authorisation. This involves an OAuth 2.0 Access Token presented in the 'Authorization' header along with the request.
